My code for Introducing Elixir, by Simon St.Laurent and J. David Eisenberg.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	I entered all this code by either copying from the book, and/or hand
entering changes. If a file name has a number in it, these are later versions
in the same example. Each time I make a change to an example, I increment
the number. In some cases, I have also added numbers to module and function
names too. I have also differentiated other names, to make them more
descriptive of what they are.

	In ask2.ex, I have made modifications outside the book. This file has
input error checking that I added.
